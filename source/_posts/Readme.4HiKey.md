Above all, you need install some applications firstly as follows:  
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y wget automake1.11 make bc libncurses5-dev libtool li
bc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 bison flex uuid-dev build-esse
ntial iasl gcc zlib1g-dev libperl-dev libgtk2.0-dev libfdt-dev
```
After you executed `./estuary/build.sh --file=./estuary/estuarycfg.json --builddir=./workspace` for HiKey, all targets files will be produced. they are:

### l-loader.bin  
### ptable-linux.img  
### AndroidFastbootApp.efi  
### UEFI_HiKey.fd  

**description**: l-loader.bin - used to switch from aarch32 to aarch64 and boot, UEFI_HiKey.fd is the UEFI bios for HiKey, ptable-linux.img - partition tables for Linux images.  
**target**:  
```bash
<project root>/workspace/binary/HiKey/l-loader.bin

<project root>/workspace/binary/HiKey/ptable-linux.img

<project root>/workspace/binary/HiKey/AndroidFastbootApp.efi

<project root>/workspace/binary/HiKey/UEFI_HiKey.fd.
```

**source**: `<project root>/uefi`

build commands(supposedly, you are in `<project root>` currently:

`./estuary/submodules/build-uefi.sh --platform=HiKey --output=workspace`

### grubaa64.efi 

**description**: grubaa64.efi is used to load kernel image and dtb files from SD card, nandflash into RAM and start the kernel.  
**target**: `<project root>/workspace/binary/arm64/grubaa64.efi`  
**source**: `<project root>/grub`  

build commands(supposedly, you are in `<project root>` currently:  
`./estuary/submodules/build-grub.sh --output=./workspace`, if your host is not arm architecture, please execute`build-grub.sh --output=./workspace --cross=aarch64-linux-gnu-`

Note: more details about how to install gcc-linaro-aarch64-linux-gnu-4.9-2014.09_linux, please refer to https://github.com/open-estuary/estuary/blob/master/doc/Toolchains_Guide.4All.md.

### Image  
### hi6220-hikey.dtb  

**descriptions**: Image is the kernel executable program, and hi6220-hikey.dtb is the device tree binary.  
**target**: Image in `<project root>/workspace/binary/arm64/Image`  
hi6220-hikey.dtb in `<project root>/workspace/binary/HiKey/hi6220-hikey.dtb`  
**source**: `<project root>/kernel`  

build commands(supposedly, you are in `<project root>` currently):  
`./estuary/submodules/build-kernel.sh --platform=HiKey --output=workspace`, if your host is not arm architecture, please execute `./estuary/submodules/build-kernel.sh --platform=HiKey --output=workspace --cross=aarch64-linux-gnu-`.
