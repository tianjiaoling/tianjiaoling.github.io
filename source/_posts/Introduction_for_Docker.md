What is Docker?

<!--more-->
Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. In details, Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries - anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in. Click on the link https://www.docker.com for more information.

Docker organization offers an official storage called Docker Hub for users to pull and push Images. For details please visit the link https://hub.docker.com. The Docker Images from open-estuary are all stored here, you can visit the link https://hub.docker.com/u/openestuary.
