After you executed `./estuary/build.sh --file=./estuary/estuarycfg.json --builddir=./workspace` for D02, all targets files will be produced. they are:

### UEFI_D02.fd 

**description**: UEFI_D02.fd is the UEFI bios for D02 platform.  
**target**: `<project root>/workspace/binary/D02/UEFI_D02.fd`  
**source**: `<project root>/uefi`

build commands(supposedly, you are in `<project root>` currently):
```shell
./estuary/submodules/build-uefi.sh --platform=D02 --output=workspace
```

### grubaa64.efi 

**description**: grubaa64.efi is used to load kernel image and dtb files from SATA, SAS, USB Disk, or NFS into RAM and start the kernel.  
**target**: `<project root>/workspace/binary/arm64/grubaa64.efi`  
**source**: `<project root>/grub`

build commands(supposedly, you are in `<project root>` currently):  
```bash
./estuary/submodules/build-grub.sh --output=./workspace
```
if your host is not arm architecture, please execute  
```bash
./estuary/submodules/build-grub.sh --output=./workspace --cross=aarch64-linux-gnu-
```
